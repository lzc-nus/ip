# Command-Line UI Test Plan

Run these tests after each application code change using the project-local `test-ui` skill. Expected values are meaningful output fragments checked in order; startup animation frames are intentionally excluded because they do not affect command behavior.

## Coverage

- Create and list all three task types with parsed, consistently formatted dates.
- Preserve `LocalDate` details while marking and unmarking through `Task` polymorphism.
- Find task descriptions by case-insensitive substring while preserving their original task numbers.
- Accept valid ISO dates, including leap days, and reject invalid dates without storing a task.
- Reject events that end before they start while allowing same-day events.
- Find deadlines and in-progress events on a date while preserving their original task numbers.
- Reject empty and unknown commands with actionable feedback.
- Reject incomplete task commands and invalid task numbers without changing stored tasks.
- Delete tasks from collection storage and renumber the remaining list.
- Reject invalid delete requests without changing stored tasks.
- Create missing storage automatically, save canonical dates on every mutation, and restore formatted dates and statuses.
- Run each automated case in isolated temporary storage so saved tasks cannot leak between cases.

## JavaFX GUI checks

Run `./gradlew run` and verify the graphical interface manually:

1. The welcome dialog appears with Green Chonk's picture in a resizable window, and the command field receives
   keyboard focus.
2. Pressing Enter and clicking **CHOMP** both add the user command and Green Chonk's response.
3. A blank or invalid command appears as a visually distinct error response without crashing the app.
4. A multi-line response keeps each fixed-size avatar aligned with the bottom edge of its message bubble.
5. Repeated commands keep the newest dialog visible by scrolling the conversation automatically.
6. `bye` displays the farewell response and then closes the window.
7. Restarting the GUI restores tasks created in the previous session.
8. Starting the GUI with `./gradlew run` does not print a restricted native-access warning.

The automated cases below continue through the command-line interface because they exercise the same parser,
commands, task list, and storage without depending on a display server.

## Persistence check

In a temporary working directory, run Green Chonk twice against the same `data/greenchonk.txt`:

1. Add a todo, deadline, and event; mark the deadline; delete the todo; then exit.
2. Start Green Chonk again and run `list`.

The second session must restore the marked deadline and event, including their parsed dates, while the deleted todo must remain absent. The data file must contain ISO dates even though the UI displays friendly dates. The test directory and data file must not exist before the first session; this verifies first-run creation as well as loading.

Also seed the data file with an event whose ending date is before its starting date. On startup, Green Chonk must identify that line as invalid rather than loading the impossible event.
